    "Before ending this first part of the TSO Level 2 activity in terms of schedulability of transits, it is important to discuss about the importance of PAs for exoplanetary spectroscopic observations, which might also be important for other scientific cases as well. Most transit, eclipse and phase-curve exoplanet observations will be made with slitless modes, which implies that light from other nearby sources in the aperture might enter the instrument and contaminate our observations. This is important to try to avoid if possible because this will dilute the transit signatures in a wavelength-dependant way, which implies corrections will most likely have to be made to the data in \n",

Currently (November 2019), this tool only works for the NIRISS SOSS mode, but it is anyways useful for other instruments as a guide at to what level of contamination to expect on our observations. Let us try it for our target. Aside from a visibility plot similar to the one shown above, this tool provides a contamination map that looks as follows:\n",

    "The outer panels in this plot show us what percentage of the wavelength chanel is being contaminated by nearby sources for a given PA, whereas the central part shows us how the contamination varies with wavelength for that same PA (with the top plot indicating important features that might appear in exoplanet spectra). In our case, PA's close to a 100 will produce some contamination, so we might want to avoid those. However, from this plot and the visibility plot, the conclusion is that most of the PAs in which our target is observable will give rise from small to no contamination. Our observations are \"safe\" in this sense!\n",
