# Time-Series Observations (TSO) | Master Class 2019 excercise solutions

This repository holds the solution to the excercises (under the `excercises_MC19.pdf` file) that were made as hands-on activities during the 
2019 version of STScI's Master Class for Time-Series Observations (TSOs).

Usage
---------------

The solutions to part 1 on transit and target observability are under `solution_part1.ipynb`. Simply click the file to check it out. Similarly, 
part 2 solutions are under `solution_part2.ipynb`. The data used to generate plots are under `data`. Note that, e.g., the data downloaded/presented 
here was downloaded during November 2019. To have the latest version of that data (e.g., instrument response functions for NIRCam), please check 
the [JWST Documentation](http://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/).
